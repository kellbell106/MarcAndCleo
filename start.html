			<p>What we'll need from you:</p>


			<p>Send us your clothes, all of your clothes... 
			We have found that the best way to photograph your wardrobe (and you're gonna need a couple of hours for this) is on clear or wire hangers against a contrasting wall. If you don't have clear or wire, try using a hanger that is closest in color to the article of clothing. And please, none of those "Thank You" hangers from the dry cleaners. Just rip the paper off already! Hang your clothes on an over-the-door or simple plastic tack-on hook. If you can't find anything that'll work without causing damage to your door or wall, have a friend help by holding the hanger against your wall without obstructing the view of the clothing. For tight, fitted tops, we recommend having someone photograph you in them so we can get the proper form. If you are uncomfortable doing this, that's ok, just understand that this part of your wardrobe will not look as realistic, but you'll still get the jist. Check out some of our samples as a guide. </p>

			<p>Now for shoes and accessories. Give us whatever you want. Got a pair of clunkers in the back of your closet you never wear? A necklace grandma gave you three birthdays ago? Scarves, jackets, belts, headdresses, ass-less chaps, etc? Send it all! Shoes should be photographed head-on, jewelry can be worn or photographed solo against a plain, contrasting background. The more it takes the shape it would have on your body, the better.</p>

			<p>Make a folder of your photos and once you have your collection ready, send your compressed file with the button we have provided, and we'll take it from there! We'll be in touch if we need anything else from you, but please give us 6-10 business days to complete your wardrobe.</p>

			<p>Happy photographing!</p>
